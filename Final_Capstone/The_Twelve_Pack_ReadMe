This report summarizes a concept program for an app that labels beer by a picture and retrieves information about the beer 
from BrweryDB's API. This concept program will utilize SciKit Learn, Tensorflow and Keras for the machine learning model, 
as well as OpenCV for image manipulation, all built on Python. Furthermore, Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy will provide the 
backbone of visulazation and data organization/exploration. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Random Forest Classifier 
(RFC) will be used to classify the beer labels.

## Getting Started

The notebook created for this repository use iPython notebooks.

```
Jupyter notebook - https://ipython.org/install.html
```
```
Tensorflow - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
```
```
Keras - https://pypi.org/project/Keras/
```
```
scitkit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
```

## Built With

[Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/) - Web framework used

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Open source library that Keras is built upon

[Keras](https://keras.io/) - Deep Learning Library
