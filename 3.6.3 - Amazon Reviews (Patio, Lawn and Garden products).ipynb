    "Use one of the following [datasets](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) to perform sentiment analysis on the given Amazon reviews. Pick one of the \"small\" datasets that is a reasonable size for your computer. The goal is to create a model to algorithmically predict if a review is positive or negative just based on its text. Try to see how these reviews compare across categories. Does a review classification model for one category work for another?\n",

Because Naive Bayes creates a binary classifier, the sentiment for this model will either be positive or negative. The datatset for Patio, Lawn and Garden products was chosen because it is relatively small, but large enough to build a good model from.\n",
